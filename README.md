# Bootstrap.Light.CSS

Bootstrap style lighter Framework (Less than 10K before gzip.)

- Same Syntax with Bootstrap;
- Just core styles implementation.
- Light Weight. 
	Html header inline use recommended.
- Focus on style and size compressing. 
	Not components or functions, which bootstrap goes too far with javascript things.

Now Size: compressed: 7.7KB, GZip: ?

### Why not [PURECSS](http://purecss.io/)?

PureCSS is small enough too: 4.3K base + lower than 5K theme(default rainbow/baby-blue theme), and well supported for basic functions.

but...

- PureCSS is a basement, not a well themed framework.
- Not easy theme building or customizing. (Which bootstrap supports LESS editing.)
- Different name space for using styles with bootstrap, which means can't switch a project smoothly between two frameworks.

### Supported List:

- <del>Grid, Basic Typography </del>
- <del>Tables, Forms, Alerts</del>
- <del>Buttons, Labels, Badges</del>
- <del>Menu, Tab, Pagination</del>
- *NOT SUPPORTED*: Fluid Grid, Navbar, Dropdown, ProgressBar, mobile responsive ?

### TODOs:

- Basic Javascript Parts seperated style plugin.
